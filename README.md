# Viral Pilot Backend Repository

## Introduction

Welcome to the Viral Pilot Backend Repository, the backbone of our innovative AI voice assistant platform. Developed as an integral part of the Viral Pilot ecosystem, this repository, powered by Express.js, is designed to manage and process all backend functionalities including data handling, API integration, and voice command processing.

**Please Note:** While this backend repository forms the core of Viral Pilot's functionality, it currently does not include the full capabilities of the voice assistant feature. We are excited to announce that we are actively developing a comprehensive Node package specifically designed for developers and businesses. This package will enable easy integration of Viral Pilot's voice assistant functionalities into various applications, significantly enhancing user interaction and accessibility.

## Technologies

This project is built using Express.js, a fast, unopinionated, minimalist web framework for Node.js. It's chosen for its efficiency in handling server-side logic, making it perfect for the scalable, efficient, and secure backend required by Viral Pilot.

## Getting Started

To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites
